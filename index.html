         <p class="info">There is so many different cities to visit. Each one so very different. There is a perfect place for everyone. My personal favorite, Florence. I love the combination of old with the new. It amazes me how Florence has been able to maintain so much of their history of their art and culture while still be a major city. Just because Florence is my favorite city and I would drop it all for a chance to move there tonight, doesn't mean it will be your favorite.

          <p class="info">Finding the right place to stay can be tough and a very tedious task. There is so many things to consider, how far is it from the sites you want to visit, is it in a nice area, do they offer breakfast, what are other travelers saying about it?! I have compiled my favorite hotels <a href="#" class="stay-link">here</a>. PD: They are are all budget friendly. Traveling doesn't always have to be super expensive!</p>

          <p class="info">Finally! My favorite part, FOOD! If you know me, you know I am definitely a lover of Italian cuisine. I could literally eat pizza every day of my life and never complain. I may or may not have eaten it for lunch and dinner for two weeks straight when visiting with my sister a couple years ago. WHAT?! We were on a budget and pizza is delicious so whatever. Back to the topic, where to eat. I have compiled a list of my favorite restaurants <a href="#" class="food-link">here</a>. I promise they aren't all pizza.</p>

          <p class="info">One of the most wonderful things about Italy is its history, it's culture, it's people! They have managed to preserve their origins so well and make sure to share their story with anyone who is willing to listen. I challenge you! Take up a conversation with one random person while in Italy. You will not regret it. <a href="#" class="food-link">Here</a> you can find a few of the historic sites that I felt made the most impact on my visits.</p>
